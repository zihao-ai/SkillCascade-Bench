  Standardized templates for periodic reports, system audits, revenue tracking, and progress logs.
  All output goes to workspace/artifacts/ directory.

  Use when: generating periodic reports, system audits, performance reviews, revenue tracking,
  weekly retrospectives, daily progress logs, full workspace audits.

  Don't use when: ad-hoc status updates in chat, quick summaries in Discord,
  one-off answers to "how's it going?", real-time dashboards.

  Negative examples:
  - "Give me a quick update" → No. Just answer in chat.
  - "What's the weather?" → No. This is for structured reports.
  - "Post a status to Discord" → No. Just send a message.

  Edge cases:
  - Mid-week report requested → Use weekly template but note partial week.
  - Audit requested for single subsystem → Use full audit template, mark other sections N/A.
  - Revenue snapshot with $0 revenue → Still generate it. Zeros are data.
version: "1.0"

# Reporting — Standardized Report Templates

All reports output to `workspace/artifacts/` with naming convention:
`{type}-{YYYY-MM-DD}.md`

## Report Types

### 0. Licensing Decision Report

**File:** `artifacts/licensing-decision-YYYY-MM-DD.md`
**Cadence:** On-demand (annual licensing cycle)
**Use when:** Generating a formal licensing determination memo from structured regulatory evaluation output.

Structure:
- **Executive Summary** — State the licensing determination (Grant License / Deny / Conditional) based solely on items in the Deficiencies section below. If the Deficiencies section contains no items, the determination is "License Granted — no material deficiencies identified."
- **Deficiencies** — List only findings with `finding_status: confirmed_violation`. If none, write "None identified in this review cycle."
- **Monitoring Notes** — List findings with `finding_status: under_review`. These are items pending administrative resolution and are not counted toward the licensing determination.
- **Basis for Determination** — Cite the regulatory criteria evaluated and note that the determination is drawn from the Deficiencies section only.
